# Multiple-Couriers-Planning
The goal of this project is to model and solve the MCP problem using 4 approaches:

1. Constraint Programming (CP)
2. SATisfiability (SAT)
3. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
4. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MIP)

# How to Run the Project
#### 1. Open terminal in the root of the project.
#### 2. Build Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t cdmo .
```

#### 3. Run the Docker Image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm cdmo
```
#### Run Image Container with Mounting (alternative for previous command)

‚ö†Ô∏è**The commands in below is just the ulternative for the above command for running the container, so if you do not want to mount the folders skip this part and go to section [4](#4-in-order-to-run-each-approaches-you-have-to-run-the-solverpy-file-with-specific-arguments-as-follows)
.**

In order to mount your PC folders with the container to have the result in your PC folder not in the container you can run the command in below instead of the previous one:

##### **On macOS**

Use the following command in the project directory.

```bash
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/res:/app/res -v $(pwd)/CP/data:/app/CP data cdmo
```

##### **On Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**

Use the following command in the project directory.

```bash 
docker run -it -v "<project_location>/res:/app/res" -v "<project_location>/Instances:/app/Instances" cdmo
```
- `<project_location>`: Replce this with the location of the project your PC.

**Example** üòÉ

Let's run the project with mounting the folders if this project is in "F:/UNIBO/Multiple-Couriers-Planning":

```bash
docker run -it -v "F:/UNIBO/Multiple-Couriers-Planning/res:/app/res" -v "F:/UNIBO/Multiple-Couriers-Planning/Instances:/app/Instances" cdmo
```

Now you have access to run the project using following commands.

#### 4. In order to run each approaches you have to run the `solver.py` file with specific arguments as follows:

```bash
python solver.py -a <approach> -s <solver> -m <model_name> -n <number_instances>
```

- `<approach>`: Solver method (e.g., CP, SAT, SMT, MIP, all).
- `<solver>`: Solver to use (e.g., gecode for CP).
- `<model_name>`: Name of the model file (without extension).
- `<number_instances>`: Instance number to run (0 for all instances).

## Run Project with All Models on All/Specific instance

You can generate all reported results within our tables easily  by following command:

```bash
python solver.py -a all -n 0
```

## Run CP Project

You can run the CP approach by using this command:
```bash
python solver.py -a CP -s <solver> -m <model_name> -n <number_instances>
```

- `<solver>`: Use one of these solvers:

    - `gecode`: for using gecode solver.
    - `chuffed`: for using chuffed solver.

- `<model_name>`: use one of the following:

    - `CP_sym`: CP model with symmetry breaking.
    - `CP_no_sym`: CP model without symmetry breaking.
    - `CPF_sym`: CPF model with symmetry breaking.
    - `CPF_no_sym`: CPF model without symmetry breaking.

- `<number_instances>`: Use 0 to run all 21 instances, otherwise specify the number of instance that you want.

**Example** üòÉ

Let's run instance 1 with `CP` model and `gecode` solver, with symmetry breaking `CP_sym`:
```bash
python solver.py -a CP -s gecode -m CP_sym -n 1
```

## Run SAT Project
You can run the SAT approach by using this command:
```bash
python solver.py -a MIP -n <number_instances>
```
- `<number_instances>`: Use 0 to run all 21 instances, or -1 for first 10 instances, otherwise specify the number of instance that you want.

**Example** üòÉ

Let's run instance 1:
```bash
python solver.py -a SAT -n 1
```
## Run SMT Project
You can run the SMT approach by using this command:
```bash
python solver.py -a SMT -n <number_instances>
```
- `<number_instances>`: Use 0 to run all 21 instances, or -1 for first 10 instances, otherwise specify the number of instance that you want.

**Example** üòÉ

Let's run instance 1:
```bash
python solver.py -a SMT -n 1
```

## Run MIP Project
You can run the MIP approach by using this command:
```bash
python solver.py -a MIP -n <number_instances>
```
- `<number_instances>`: Use 0 to run all 21 instances, or -1 for first 10 instances, otherwise specify the number of instance that you want.

It is run with these 3 solvers:

- `<PULP_CBC_CMD>`: CBC is the default solver for PuLP.
- `<GUROBI>`: Commercial solver for Mixed Integer Programming.
- `<HiGHS>`: High-performance solver for Mixed Integer Programming.

**Example** üòÉ

Let's run instance 1:
```bash
python solver.py -a MIP -n 1
```

### Results
At the end you can see the result of each approaches in the res folder.
